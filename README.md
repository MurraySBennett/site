# Murray Bennett website

This repo hosts projects (incl. descriptions and current progress), publications, other CV-like stuff, and side-quests for Murray Bennett. 
You can find the site linked to this GitRepo at https://murraysbennett.github.io/site.

Upon visiting the site you'll quickly become aware that whilst it has a wonderfully selected colour palette there is still much to be desired in the way of content. Your patience is appreciated. Be aware that the rate of content does have a stunning relationship with my rate of learning HTML/CSS.

Initial (and, to be honest, much of the current) design generated with help from Kevin Powell via freeCodeCamp.org.
